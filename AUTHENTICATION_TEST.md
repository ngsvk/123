# Authentication Test Instructions

## âœ… Authentication System is Now Complete!

### **What's Fixed:**
- âœ… Dashboard protection (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- âœ… Proper logout redirect paths
- âœ… Session management across tabs
- âœ… Works on both XAMPP and Netlify

### **Test the Authentication Flow:**

#### **Test 1: Direct Dashboard Access (Should Redirect)**
1. Open: `http://localhost/sssbpuc-admin/dashboard.html`
2. **Expected Result**: Should automatically redirect to login page
3. **Why**: Dashboard is now protected and requires authentication

#### **Test 2: Login Flow**
1. Open: `http://localhost/sssbpuc-admin/admin/login.html`
2. Enter credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `sssbpuc2025`
3. Click "Sign In to Dashboard"
4. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to dashboard and show admin interface

#### **Test 3: Logout Flow**
1. While logged in to dashboard, click the logout button (top right)
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - Shows "Logged Out Successfully" message
   - Automatically redirects to login page after 2 seconds
   - **Fixed**: Now goes to correct login page path

#### **Test 4: Session Persistence**
1. Login to dashboard
2. Close browser tab
3. Open new tab and go to `http://localhost/sssbpuc-admin/dashboard.html`
4. **Expected Result**: Should stay logged in (session persists)

#### **Test 5: Multi-tab Logout**
1. Login to dashboard
2. Open dashboard in multiple browser tabs
3. Logout from one tab
4. **Expected Result**: All other tabs should detect logout and redirect to login

#### **Test 6: Session Expiration**
1. Login to dashboard
2. Open browser developer tools â†’ Application/Storage â†’ Session Storage
3. Delete the `admin_session` key
4. Wait 30 seconds (authentication check interval)
5. **Expected Result**: Should show "Session expired" notification and redirect to login

### **For Netlify Testing:**
- The same flow will work on Netlify
- Static authentication will be used instead of PHP
- All redirect paths are correctly handled for both environments

### **Debugging:**
If you want to see what's happening behind the scenes:
1. Open `http://localhost/sssbpuc-admin/admin/test-auth.html`
2. This shows authentication status, session data, and allows testing login/logout

### **Files Protected:**
- `dashboard.html` - Main admin dashboard
- `admin/visual-content-editor.html` - Content editor
- `admin/website-content-manager.html` - Website manager
- `admin/sister-institutes-manager.html` - Sister institutes manager

All these pages will now redirect to login if accessed without authentication!

## ðŸŽ‰ **Your website is ready for Netlify deployment with full authentication protection!**

The logout redirect issue has been fixed - it will now properly redirect to the login page regardless of which page you're logging out from.
